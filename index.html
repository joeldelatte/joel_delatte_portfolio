              My name is Joel David Delatte. I grew up around New Orleans, Louisiana. I've loved the guitar since I was two years old and learned in church and at home. Eventually, I studied Music Theory and guitar performance in college. I grew up nagging my cajun grandparents to teach me to cook and learned everything I could at home. During college I worked in restaurants and eventually worked my way into becoming a chef. Over my last decade in 
              the kitchen I have watched many close friends and my wife attend bootcamps and move into tech careers. After getting my feet wet with some coding and seeing how my music theory thought processes can relate, the possibilities began to open 
              up to me. In all of my experinece with managing inventory, ordering and people management, I have come across many problems that I believe could be solved with well designed web applications. I am studying full stack web development with a focus on javascript, Node and React and mysql and MongoDb databases and hope to create new tools help with operations in my current industry.
